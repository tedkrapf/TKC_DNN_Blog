# TKC_DNN_Blog
A uber-simple port of the DNN6-era DNN Blog module for DNN 9+

IMPORTANT
To clone/use this -- in [DNN local site/dev folder]/DesktopModules, create a "TKC_DnnBlog" folder.  Clone the repo into this folder.  Then move the .sln file up a folder into the dnn/DesktopModules folder.  Then you can launch the Solution.

This is a crazy simple port of the DNN6-era DNN Blog Module to DNN9+.  Basically I had a few quick & dirty (old) DNN sites that needed to be upgraded to the latest DNN.  The old DNN Blog modules obviously won't work with DNN9.

This port leverages the original DNN Blog SQL tables (e.g. dbo.Blog_blog, Blog_Entry) and provides a Recent Articles, Article List (w/ simple summary), and Article Details.

If you'd like to contribute to improve upon this humble/early beginnings, please feel free to do so.
